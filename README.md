# i_am_rich

A Flutter Application. This is my first Flutter Application, an attempt of me trying to break into mobile app development.

## Getting Started

This project is my version of the famous, 'I Am Rich' iOS application by Armin Heinrich (created for the purpose of getting more familiar with Flutter widgets). 

## Key Takeaways
- [x] MaterialApp widget is the first ancestor for most applications 
- [x] Used the Scaffold Widget for easy manupulation of Layout
- [x] Used the AppBar widget to edit the appBar data field of my Scaffold widget
- [x] Used different colors of the Colors class(e.g Colors.blue[900])
- [x] Generated android and iOS icons to replace default Flutter application icons
- [x] Added images as Assets and was able to use both the Image widget and the AssetImage class
